                <h3>Project One: HandWritten Text Recognition</h3>
                <p><b>Description:</b> 
                    Handwritten text recognition involves using algorithms to convert cursive or printed text written by hand into machine-readable text.
                     This technology employs machine learning models, often leveraging neural networks, to understand and transcribe various handwriting styles.
                      It finds applications in digitizing documents, automating data entry, and improving accessibility.</p>

                <h3>Project Two: Feature Selection Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <p><b>Description:</b>
                
                    Feature selection in supervised learning involves choosing relevant features that improve the model's performance by focusing on labeled data
                     to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. In unsupervised learning, feature selection identifies significant features by analyzing patterns 
                     and relationships within the data without labels, often to improve clustering or dimensionality reduction. Both approaches aim to simplify models 
                     and improve computational efficiency.</p>
